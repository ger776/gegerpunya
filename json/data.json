        "I used cross-plots, Phyton, WMS, and GrADS to process and analyze meteorological datasets, including synoptic observations, reanalysis products, and satellite-derived parameters. Through these tools, I conducted pattern recognition, temporal–spatial visualization, and variable correlation analysis to better understand atmospheric processes and hydro-meteorological behavior.",
        "In Meteorology I learned many things, starts from Tools until Data Processing and Analyze. The Tools are WMS, QGis, Google Colab, GrAdS, and many more.",
        "No less important, I experienced a lot of field work and lab work in Groundwater Engineering. "
